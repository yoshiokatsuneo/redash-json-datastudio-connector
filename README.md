# Redash JSON API connector - Community Connector for Data Studio
This [Data Studio] [Community Connector] lets users query data from a [JSON]
data source.

This is based on [JSON connect](https://github.com/googledatastudio/community-connectors/blob/master/JSON-connect/README.md)

## Set up the Community Connector for personal use

To use this Community Connector in Data Studio there is a one-time setup to
deploy your own personal instance of the connector using Apps Script.

### Deploy the connector

Follow the [deployment guide] to deploy the Community Connector.

## Using the connector in Data Studio

Once you've set up and deployed the connector, follow the
[Use a Community Connector] guide to use the connector in Data Studio.

**Note**: After using the connector in Data Studio, as long as you do not
[revoke access], it will remain listed in the [connector list] for easy access
when [creating a new data source].
